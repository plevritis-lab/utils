# utils

a collection of open-source useful utility scripts for processing CODEX data; processing modules are organized by folder and each have their own `README.md` for step-by-step guidelines

in brief:
- `celesta`: includes template scripts for batch celesta processing and integrated visualization of assignments, proteomic images, and histology
- `pathology`: implements post-processing of histology images for figure generation
- `segmentation`: provides wrappers around mesmer and cellpose for segmentation and cell measurement quantification
- `visualization`: incorporates various visualization utilities for figure generation

the above were tested using `python/3.9.4`
